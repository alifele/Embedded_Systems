How to setup the stm32f103RC micro controllers (Generally all of the stm32f10x micro controllers)

1. install keil uvision

2. download and install the MDK legacy support from the http://www2.keil.com/mdk5/legacy

3. open new project

4. in the wizard select the microcontroller type (in my case it was stm32f103RC). make sure to select the chip form 'legacy device database'. if you
don't have this option make sure you have done step 2 correctly

5. it is recommended to create three Source Group folders with names : User, MCSIS, MCSIS Driver. you can also rename the 'source group 1' to 'Startup'.

6. create main.c file containing the following code :
'''
int main(){
	while(1){
	}
}
'''

7. add the file to the Startup folders

8. if you compile the code you will get the 'undefined error SystemInit error. To solve this you should do the following:

9. go to the folder of your project. make the 'inc' (i.e. include) and 'src' (i.e. source ) folders. these are recommended as to keep the
project directory clean.

10. go to the clone the stm32f10x-MCSIS libraries folder in my github page : https://github.com/alifele/STM32-and-STM8-MicroController

11. from the 'STM32f10x-CMSIS Libraries\STM32F10x_StdPeriph_Lib_V3.5.0\Libraries\CMSIS\CM3\DeviceSupport\ST\STM32F10x' path add the system_stmf10x.c file to
the 'src' folder and system_stmf10x.h file to the 'inc' folder that were created in step 9.

12. from keil, left click on the CMSIS Drivers and select 'add existing file to folder'. From the dialog window select the system_stmf10x.c file.

13. to say the keil where to look for the header files, you should define path of the header files. to do this left click on the target 1 and go to the options.
in the C/C++ tab define your path in which in our case is the 'inc' folder.

14. now if you compile the project you will get no errors. thats it. you could set up keil and libraries. But suppose that you want to use the General Purpose
Input Output pins. you should import the required source file and header file to project. But this procedure is a little bit tricky. Come with me:

15. to use the GPIOs or other libraries you should #include <stm32f10x.h> to the main.c file. So add the header file from 'STM32f10x-CMSIS Libraries\
STM32F10x_StdPeriph_Lib_V3.5.0\Libraries\CMSIS\CM3\DeviceSupport\ST\STM32F10x' path to the 'inc' folder. and the #include <stm32f10x.h> to main.c file

16. if you get the 'target selection error', go to the stm32f10x.h header file and select the type of your board. mine is STM32F10X_HD

17. if you now compile the main.c once again you will get 'symbol assert_parat' error. to solve this go to the option, C/C++ tab and define the following values
as the preprocessor symbols : STM32f10x_CL, USE_STDPERIPH_DRIVER

18. after doing this you will get the error in the #include part of code which says that I can't find a file. to add stm32f10x_conf.h go to :
'STM32f10x-CMSIS Libraries\STM32F10x_StdPeriph_Lib_V3.5.0\Project\STM32F10x_StdPeriph_Template' and add stm32f10x_conf.h to 'inc'.

19. now the last step to solve all of the errors add all of the header files in 'STM32F10x_StdPeriph_Lib_V3.5.0\Libraries\CMSIS\CM3\DeviceSupport\ST\STM32F10x
\inc' path to the 'inc folder in the project folder'
